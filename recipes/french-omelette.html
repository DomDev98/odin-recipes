        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A classic French omelette is elegant and chic, a beauty to behold. The smooth, pale yellow 
            exterior envelops soft curds of creamy, delicate eggs. It’s almond-shaped and has no filling— 
            just eggs, glorified in their gentle essence.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>---------------------------------------</p>

        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>Pinch salt</li>
            <li>Pinch white pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Finely chopped chives or parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <p>---------------------------------------</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Beat the eggs:</h4>
                <p>
                    In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until no traces of white remain. Whisk in the salt 
                    and white pepper.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Melt the butter:</h4>
                <p>
                    In a 8-inch nonstick skillet with rounded sides set over medium heat, melt the butter, 
                    being careful not to let it brown. Swirl it around in the pan so it coats the bottom and  
                    sides.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Cook the eggs:</h4>
                <p>
                    Pour the eggs into the pan. With the bowl of a fork, tines facing up, rapidly stir the eggs. 
                    If you’re concerned about scraping the nonstick surface of your pan, use a plastic fork. 
                    Move the fork all around the pan to break up the eggs as they cook. At the same time, hold 
                    the handle of the pan with the other hand and vigorously shake the pan back and forth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the eggs cook too fast, forming large clumps, take the pan off the heat and keep stirring. 
                    The eggs will continue to cook a little from the residual heat. Cook until the eggs are loose 
                    and creamy with small curds. This will only take 2 to 3 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Roll the omelette:</h4>
                <p>
                    If you haven’t already done so, remove the pan from the heat. Run the fork around the edges to 
                    release the eggs. Tilt the pan to a 45-degree angle so that the eggs move to one side of the pan. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep the pan tilted and fold the eggs toward the edge until you have a half moon shape, running 
                    the fork under and around the eggs as needed to loosen them from the pan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the pan still tilted, sharply tap the handle 2 or 3 times with your free hand to push the eggs 
                    over the edge by about 2 inches. If this makes no sense, that’s okay—use a spatula to gently coax 
                    the eggs about 2 inches over the edge of the pan. Use your fork to fold the overhanging eggs up and 
                    towards the center of the omelette. It should now be almond-shaped.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Transfer the omelette onto the plate:</h4>
                <p>
                    Hold onto the handle as close to the pan as possible. Bang the still tilted pan on the counter to move 
                    the omelette right up to the edge of the pan. Tilt a plate right next to the omelette and tip it onto 
                    the plate so the seam is on the bottom.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Serve the omelette:</h4>
                <p>
                    Sprinkle with chives or parsley, if you'd like, and serve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The omelette is best eaten just after you make it. The texture will change, but you could wrap leftovers 
                    in plastic wrap and store it in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. To reheat, cover it with a dampened paper 
                    towel and microwave in 30-second intervals, until heated through. The key is to reheat it gently, so the 
                    eggs don’t overcook.
                </p>

        </ol>
