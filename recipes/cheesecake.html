        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a classic New York-style cheesecake with a graham cracker crust and high sides. 
            It is rich, dense, and light at the same time, and serves a small army.
        </p>
        <p>But watch out! Just when you think you've made enough for your gathering, so many people 
            will go back for seconds that you may be left without a piece!

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <p>---------------------------------------</p>

        <h4>Prepare the crust</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Preheat the oven to 350° F.</h4>
                <p>Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Process the crust ingredients:</h4>
                <p>Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor or blender until finely ground. Put in 
                    a large bowl, and stir in the sugar and salt. Stir in the melted butter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Press into a springform pan:</h4>
                <p>Use a 9x2 3/4-inch round springform pan. Gently press down on the crumbs using your fingers, 
                    until the crumbs are a nice even layer at the bottom of the pan, with maybe just a slight 
                    rise along the inside edges of the pan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Bake:</h4>
                <p>Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven 
                    and let cool.</p>
                <p><strong>Lower the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C).</strong></p>
                <p>While the crust is cooling, you can skip ahead and start on the filling. Wait until the crust 
                    has cooled to wrap the pan in foil in the next step.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Triple wrap the pan in heavy duty foil:</h4>
                <p>Prepare the springform pan, so no water leaks into it while cooking. Place a large 18-inch by 
                    18-inch square of heavy duty aluminum foil on a flat surface.</p>
                <p>Place the springform pan in the middle of the foil. Gently fold up the sides of the foil around 
                    the pan. <em>Make sure to do this gently, so you don't create any holes in the foil.</em></p>
                <p>If there are any holes, water will get into the pan and ruin the crust.</p>
                <p>Press the foil around the edges of the pan. Place a second large square of foil underneath the 
                    pan, and repeat, gently folding up the sides of the foil around the pan and pressing the foil 
                    against the pan.</p>
                <p>To be triply safe, repeat with a third layer of heavy duty foil. Gently crimp the top of the foil 
                    sheets around the top edge of the pan.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Make the cheesecake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Beat the cream cheese, then add the sugar and beat:</h4>
                <p>Cut the cream cheese into chunks and place in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle 
                    attachment. Mix on medium speed for 4 minutes until smooth, soft and creamy. Add the sugar and 
                    beat for 4 minutes more.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Add the salt, vanilla, then eggs, then sour cream:</h4>
                <p>Add the salt and vanilla, mixing just until incorporated. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on 
                    low speed for 30 seconds after each addition. Remember to scrape down the sides of the bowl, and 
                    scrape up any thicker bits of cream cheese that have stuck to the bottom of the mixer that paddle 
                    attachment has failed to incorporate.</p>
                <p>Add the sour cream and mix on medium speed until incorporated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Add the heavy cream:</h4>
                <p>Add the heavy cream and mix on low speed until incorporated</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Prepare the pan and boiling water:</h4>
                <p>Place the foil-wrapped springform pan in a large, high-sided roasting pan. Prepare 2 quarts of 
                    boiling water.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Pour the filling into the pan:</h4>
                <p>Pour the cream cheese filling into the springform pan, over the graham cracker bottom layer. 
                    Smooth the top with a rubber spatula.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Place in the oven:</h4>
                <p>Place the roasting pan with the springform pan in it into the oven on the lower rack.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Carefully pour the hot water into the roasting pan:</h4>
                <p>Without touching the hot oven, carefully pour the hot water into the roasting pan to create 
                    a water bath for the cheesecake, pouring until the water reaches halfway up the side of the 
                    springform pan, about 1 1/4 inches. (Alternatively, you can add the water before putting the 
                    pan in the oven, whichever is easier for you.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Bake:</h4>
                <p>Bake at 325°F (160°C) for 1 1/2 hours.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Turn off the oven and let the cake cool inside:</h4>
                <p>Turn the oven off and crack open the oven door 1 inch. Let the cheesecake cool in the oven, as 
                    the oven cools for another hour. This gentle cooling will help prevent the cheesecake surface 
                    from cracking.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Chill the cheesecake in the fridge:</h4>
                <p>Carefully cover the top of the cheesecake with foil, so it doesn't actually touch the cheesecake. 
                    Chill in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours, or overnight.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Finish and Serve the Cheesecake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Prepare the sour cream topping:</h4>
                <p>Place sour cream in a medium sized bowl. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla, and stir until smooth. 
                    Chill until you are ready to serve the cake.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Prepare the raspberry sauce (optional)</h4>
                <p>Place raspberries, sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Use a potato masher to mash the raspberries. 
                    Heat on medium, whisking, about 5 minutes, until the sauce begins to thicken. Remove from heat, and 
                    let cool.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Remove the cheesecake from the pan:</h4>
                <p>Remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator. Remove the foil from the sides of the pan, and place the 
                    cake on your cake serving dish. Run the side of a blunt knife between the edge of the cake and the pan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Top with the sour cream mixture:</h4>
                <p>Spread the top with the sour cream mixture. Serve plain or drizzle individual slices with raspberry 
                    sauce or sauce of your choice.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
